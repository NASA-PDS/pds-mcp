## FastMCP Server around PDS API OpenAPI Specification

This repository also includes an experimental FastMCP server implementation built around the PDS API OpenAPI specification. The goal of this server is to provide a quick way to explore how MCP servers can be wired up to the PDS API and to showcase a lightweight approach for prototyping.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This implementation is unstable and not recommended for production use. The underlying PDS API still has a number of unimplemented features, which can lead to incomplete or inconsistent behavior. Treat this as a reference example or a starting point for experimentation rather than a fully supported solution.
